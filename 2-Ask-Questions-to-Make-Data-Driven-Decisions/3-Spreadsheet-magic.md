## Activity: Basic spreadsheet tasks

We received a sample dataset of the *Population of Latin and Caribbean countries from 2010 to 2019* that can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HalKDAXk92cWjxfjAnLOAUwwPlRtzn5w2K_mJme0OAA/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel file](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-population-lac-countries-data.xlsx). We were tasked with performing these basic spreadsheet activities:

- open a new spreadsheet
- create a new folder
- change cell size
- make attributes stand out
- add or delete columns
- add a border

As I am an advanced spreadsheet user, I used a new Google Sheets feature introduced in May 2024 **"Convert to table"** to apply automatic formatting to the table such as emphasized headers, filtering, resizing columns and naming the data range. The formatted spreadsheet can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13eJDtozw4Y7w59CeRhKBw6z8A95KU25br7WvEQVHoDQ/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel file](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-population-lac-countries-activity.xlsx).

## Activity: Formulas for success

We received a sample dataset of *Monthly Sales* that can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/125ahFIEOhVEmwSK0GYQeIqYuVcvYZgWNECzAtjb9_fo/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-formulas-success-data.xlsx). This activity covers the basics of using spreadsheet formulas for calculations including correcting errors and I performed the following actions in Google Sheets:

- used the **"Convert to table"** feature to apply automatic formatting
- applied consistent formatting to all numbers
- added additional columns for "Average Sales" and "June to July changes"
- calculated the "Total Sales" using the function `=SUM(B3:E3)` instead of the formula `=B3+C3+D3+E3`
- calculated the "Average Sales" using the function `=AVERAGE(B2:E2)` instead of the formula `=(B2+C2+D2+E2)/4`
- calculated the "June to July changes" using the formula `=(E2-D2)/D2`
- corrected the formula error by inserting the value 75866 for June 2019
- as the percentage change for June to July 2017 did not provide the expected result of 247.5%, I changed the June 2017 sales from 4002 to 47002
- applied percentage formatting to "June to July changes"

The completed activity can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yuHGrBhFNLR-Kaw6qXvGpzt26TDNj1HgQ-lXAawGrYw/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-formulas-success-activity.xlsx).

## Activity: Essential metrics

We received a sample dataset of *Bakery Sales March 2020* that can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oBxZKfxhjIB9XwqKmPdsa6kDbMIjgKxQsG4xUWdO6NM/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-bakery-sales-202003-data.xlsx). This activity illustrates how to use formulas to calculate essential metrics that reveal the revenue generated by each product. To this end, I performed the following actions in Google Sheets:

- used the **"Convert to table"** feature to apply automatic formatting
- added the column "Revenue"
- calculated the revenue using the formula `=C2*D2`
- create a new table with columns for "Product", "Price", "Total Sold" and "Total Revenue"
- created a visible break between the two tables by filling column F in a dark grey
- used the function `=SORT(UNIQUE(B2:B))` to extract the individual product lines instead of typing it out as indicated in the activity
- used the function `=VLOOKUP($G2,$B$2:$C$31, 2, FALSE)` to look-up the price of each product instead of typing it out as indicated in the activity
- calculated the total units sold per product line using the function `=SUMIF($B$2:$B,$G2,$D$2:$D)` instead of error prone `=D3+D8+D13+D18+D22`
- calculated the total revenue per product line using the formula `=H2*I2`
- added totals to the "Total Sold" and "Total Revenue" columns with the SUM function

The completed activity can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qeQh2eOofs_kwiCFEKYxUIoF68P9gClfsC0aCDJXEhc/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-bakery-sales-202003-activity.xlsx).

## Defining the problem

The ***problem domain*** is the specific area you're analyzing, encompassing everything that affects or is affected by the problem. Understanding the problem domain involves identifying all its parts and relationships to grasp the complete story behind the data. Just like solving a jigsaw puzzle without knowing the final image is difficult, data analysis requires a clear understanding of the problem to be solved. Data analysts often start projects without a complete picture, making it crucial to define the problem domain and use ***structured thinking*** to find the best solution.

### Structured thinking

Structured thinking is the process of:

- recognizing the current problem or situation,
- organizing available information,
- revealing gaps and opportunities, and
- identifying the options.

It's having a clear list of:

- what you are expected to deliver,
- a timeline for major tasks and activities, and
- checkpoints so the team knows you're making progress.

Practice structured thinking and avoid mistakes is by using a ***scope of work***.

### Scope of work

A scope of work (SOW) is an agreed-upon outline of the work. It is project-based and sets the expectations and boundaries. It can includes things like:

- data preparation
- data validation
- analysis of quantitative and qualitative datasets
- initial results
- visuals to get the point across

A scope of work may be included in a statement of work to help define project outcomes, but it is not be confused. A statement of work is a document that clearly identifies the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide to an organization. It includes objectives, guidelines, deliverables, schedule, and costs.

A template to use when creating a scope of work can be accessed [here](/2-Ask-Questions-to-Make-Data-Driven-Decisions/template-scope-of-work.pdf). Some examples of scope of work activities:

#### Deliverable

- Estimated budget for the event
- Goals for the employee training event
- List of employees to invite

#### Timeline

- Hold the training event July 1
- Send event reminder email June 25
- Invite all attendees by June 1

#### Milestones

- Confirm list of employees who will attend
- Confirm budget
- Confirm staff trainers

#### Report

- Performance improvement one month after training
- Employee feedback after the training
- Final list of employees who attended

### The importance of context

Context can turn raw data into meaningful information. It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. This means giving the data perspective by defining it. To do this, you need to identify:

| Question | Context |
| --- | --- |
| **Who** | The person or organization that created, collected, and/or funded the data collection |
| **What** | The things in the world that data could have an impact on |
| **Where** | The origin of the data |
| **When** | The time when the data was created or collected |
| **Why** | The motivation behind the creation or collection |
| **How** | The method used to create or collect it |

Effective questions follow the SMART methodology and effective questions can lead to key insights you can use to solve all kinds of problems. In order to craft an SOW, the requirements of the project must be clarified and the expectations set. This can only be done by asking effective questions. It is important to analyze datasets to obtain insights that can solve business problems and turn it into actionable insights.
