    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this activity is to explore the main types of SQL joins and how the tables are connected based on a primary key from one table and a foreign key from the other table. **Primary keys** reference columns in which each value is unique to that table, and **foreign keys** are values in a table that match primary key values in another table thus creating a link between the two tables. The four main types of SQL joins are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| JOIN | Definition |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **INNER** | A function that returns records with matching values in both tables |\n",
    "| **LEFT** | A function that returns all the records from the left table (first mentioned) and only the matching records from the right table (second mentioned) |\n",
    "| **RIGHT** | A function that returns all records from the right table (second mentioned) and only the matching records from the left table (first mentioned) |\n",
    "| **OUTER** | A function that combines the RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN to return all matching records in both tables |\n",
