# Generate a chart from a spreadsheet

## Scenario

The company relies on tourists for the bulk of its sales. The tourist season has a direct impact on the demand for inventory and staffing requirements. To help determine optimal inventory and staffing levels, leadership requires an analysis of total sales trends for the last three years to help with the forecasting for next year.

## Data

The monthly sales data used can viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G2r8RuzynC7pc3tVFh6VtRARigpM5Oq3JQLhUXun74g/edit?usp=sharing) or in the [Excel file](/activities/spreadsheets/c01m03-generate-chart/c01m03-monthly-sales-data.png). This spreadsheet contains total sales data for each month beginning in January 2021 and ending in December 2023. A portion of the spreadsheet is shown below.

## Preparation

As the dates (column A) were in date format, I needed to manipulate the data so that I can extract the graph that I had in mind for this visualization. Here is the steps I followed:

1. Added column B to extract the year from the date column using the formula `=YEAR(A2)`. This will be used for look-up purposes in column F.
2. Added column C to extract the month and year from the date column in string format using the formula `=TEXT(A2,"mmm yyyy")`. This column will be used to display all the months neatly formatted in the graph.
3. Added column E to assign a value to the cell based on its yearly rank calculated in column F using the formula `=IF(OR(F2=1,F2=2,F2=3),ROUNDUP(MAX($D$2:$D),-4),0)`. The formula determines the 3 months with the highest sales in any given month, and assigns the maximum monthly sales amount over the entire range rounded up to the nearest 10,000. This is a helper column used for shading in the graph to highlight the months with the most sales.
4. Added column F to assign a rank for each month of the year based on the amount of sales in that specific year using the formula `=RANK(D2, FILTER(D:D, B:B=B2), 0)`. Column D contains the total sales for the month and the formula determines it's rank descending so that the month with the most sales will be 1 and the month with the least will be 12. It uses a filter to ensure that the year in column B is the same for the range being ranked.
5. Inserted a combo graph in a separate sheet using the data in columns C, D and E. The total sales in column D is indicated using a line graph, and an area graph for the values assigned for shading purposes in column E to highlight the top 3 sales months.

The spreadsheet containing the analyzed data after preparation and with the graph visualization can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AjwcXVJLBfLqIksQ4Q1VRIia4kbJ2dTjCmJyD1KLHzc/edit?usp=sharing) or in the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c01m03-generate-chart/c01m03-monthly-sales-analysis.xlsx).

## Visualization

The total monthly sales for the period January 2021 to December 2023 is visualized in the graph below:

## Conclusion

From the analysis and visualization, it can be concluded that the months of December, January and February are the peak tourist season. To anticipate the increased demand in tourist season and to ensure optimal inventory and staffing levels, it is recommended that more inventory is added and additional staff recruited for the months of December to February.
