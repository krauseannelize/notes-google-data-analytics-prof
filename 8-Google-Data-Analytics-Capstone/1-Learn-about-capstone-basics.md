## What are Case Studies?

Case studies are practice data analytics projects that simulate real-world scenarios, often used by employers to evaluate job skills.
They typically involve analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and presenting findings within a given time frame.

## Building a Data Analytics Portfolio

A portfolio is a collection of case studies that demonstrate your data analysis skills and experience. You can host your portfolio on platforms like:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/),
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), or
- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/),

and link it to your resume to impress potential employers.

### Personal websites

This visualization from data analyst [Bill Yost’s website](https://www.billyost.net/) demonstrates his ability to create a Tableau visualization but also tells a very personal story about his battle with cancer. Potential employers get an idea of his skills and find out a lot more about who he is at the same time.

### GitHub

One of the tips you have been given in this program is to keep an electronic journal of things to remember, especially for SQL or R syntax. If something in your electronic journal is particularly useful, you can create a document for your portfolio in GitHub. For inspiration, check out this [R usage tips](https://github.com/erikaduan/R-tips/blob/master/README.md) read me document a GitHub user posted.

## What to include in your portfolio?

| What | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Biography** | Write a concise and clear introduction of yourself. The goal is to capture your audience’s interest and compel them to want to meet you to learn more. |
| **Contact page** | Be sure to include a way for others to get in touch with you, whether it be via email, phone, or social media handles (especially LinkedIn). You might find that your website has its own built-in contact form if you use common website builders. |
| **Resume** | Include a resume somewhere in your portfolio that reflects your skills and your experience. |
| **Accomplishments** | You are not just limited to your past experiences. Any present career-worthy highlights you can think of should be included. This can be any certifications you have earned, data analytics events you have attended, or even blog posts you have published. |
| **An image of you (optional)** | Add a personal touch with your photo. All you need is a simple, clear photo that represents you well. |

## What to include in a case study?

During the interview process, you will very likely be provided with a business-related scenario where you analyze a problem and come up with the best solution (case study interview) within a certain amount of time. A great case study will include the following:

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Introduction** | State the purpose of the case study, including the scenario and an explanation on how it relates to a real-world obstacle. Feel free to note any assumptions or theories you might have depending on the information provided. |
| **Problems** | Identify what the major problems are, explain how you have analyzed the problem, and present any facts you are using to support your findings. |
| **Solutions** | Outline a solution that would alleviate the problem and have a few alternatives in mind to show that you have given the case study considerable thought. Don’t forget to include pros and cons for each solution. |
| **Conclusion** | End the presentation by summarizing key takeaways of all of the problem-solving you conducted, highlighting what you have learned from this. |
| **Next steps** | Choose the best solution and propose recommendations for the client or business to take. Explain why you made your choice and how this will affect the scenario in a positive way. Be specific and include what needs to be done, who should enforce it, and when. |
