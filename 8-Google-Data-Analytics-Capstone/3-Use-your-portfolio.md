## Elevator pitch

Having a portfolio is great, but being able to effectively talk about your work takes it to the next level, especially during job interviews. A well-crafted elevator pitch can make your portfolio a powerful tool to impress potential employers. An ***elevator pitch*** is just a short, concise statement describing an idea or a concept in a way that grabs attention and sparks interest.
When crafting your elevator pitch, focus on the key aspects of your case study, like the problem, your approach, and the outcome. When crafting your elevator pitch, focus on the key aspects of your case study, like -

- the problem,
- your approach, and
- your findings.

Potential employers and recruiters want to get to know your thought process *and* your approach to problem-solving so focus on both when discussing your case studies.

## Negotiate your contract

Negotiating a job offer is an essential part of the interview process, even for entry-level roles. Let's take a closer look at how to be prepared when the time comes.

### Research

Research the salary range for similar roles in your location to determine a fair offer. Understand your value as a candidate based on your unique skills and experience, which can empower you during negotiations.

### Don’t just focus on money

Keep things in mind that are important to you and could be provided as a part of your compensation package, such as:

- sign-on bonuses
- vacation days
- paid time off
- sick days
- retirement plans
- healthcare coverage

If they are unable to increase your starting salary, you may want to explore asking for benefits or more perks to be included in your starting package.

### Negotiate

If asked if you have a rate or salary range in mind at the beginning of the interview, do not respond with a specific number before knowing the actual number for the role because the moment you do, you will be giving up negotiating power. Always remember that negotiation is your right and it is not considered impolite. Negotiating displays your confidence and tenacity to advocate for yourself.

### Focus on long-term growth

If it makes practical sense to take the initial offer, you should consider reevaluating in 12 months or whenever you have amassed more experience and will have more leverage to work with.
