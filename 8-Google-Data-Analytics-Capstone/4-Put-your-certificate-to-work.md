## AI in data analytics

***Artificial intelligence (AI)*** refers to computer systems that can perform cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. You can use AI tools to augment and automate various data analysis tasks, such as data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, and generating visualizations and reports.

One specific type of AI is ***generative AI (gen AI)***, which is AI that can generate new content, like text, images, or other media. In your work as a data analyst, you can leverage generative AI tools to help you complete both practical and creative tasks to work more efficiently and effectively, for example:

- **Create content**: Generate text, images, and other media
- **Analyze information quickly**: Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in datasets
- **Answer questions in detailed and nuanced ways**: Summarize information, obtain explanations of complex statistical concepts, help writing SQL queries, suggest appropriate data analysis techniques for a specific problem
- **Simplify day-to-day work**: Augment routine tasks such as data cleaning and preprocessing, automate report generation, create code snippets for data analysis

## Effective prompting

A ***prompt*** is the input you provide the AI model to elicit a specific response. A good prompt follows a simple framework:

| Step | What | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Task** | Define what you want the model to do. Include persona and format. | *"Take on a persona like a professional speech writer and create a bulleted list of key points for a presentation."* |
| **Context** | Provide necessary details to help the AI understand your needs. | *"Give me five ideas for a birthday present. My budget is $30. The gift is for a 29-year-old who loves winter sports."* |
| **References** | Include examples or references for the AI to use. | *"Previously, I gave gifts like a ski pass and a snowboard helmet."* |
| **Evaluate** | Assess if the output meets your needs. | Did the input you provided give you the output you needed? |
| **Iterate** | Refine the prompt by adding more information or editing as needed. | If the output isn't what you need, provide additional context or adjust the task and context steps. |

Remember to use natural language and be clear and specific in your instructions.
